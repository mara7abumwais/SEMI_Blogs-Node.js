Blogs Application
1. User Management:
Registration:
  Users can sign up with a username, email, and password.
Implement server-side validation for email uniqueness.
During the registration process, a unique verification token will be generated and sent to the user's provided email address (I have used the nodemailer package to send emails).

Email Verification:
Users must verify their email addresses before being able to log in.
Only verified users can log in to the system.

Authentication:
Users can log in using their email and password.
   Use a secure session management system using JSON web token (I have used the jsonwebtoken package).

User Profile:
Users have a profile page displaying their username, email, and other relevant information.
Allow users to edit their profile details.
Users can add bio and profile pictures.
(I have implemented updating profile images using the Multer middleware, and uploaded images to Cloudinary). 

Password Recovery:
Implement a "forgot password" feature that allows users to reset their password via email.

2. Blog Posts:
Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD):
    Authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts.
Anyone can display all the blogs.  
  Each blog post should have a title, content, publication date, category, and author.

Categories:
Allow users to categorize their blog posts with categories.
Each Category has a name and description.

Comments:
Authenticated users can leave comments on blog posts.

3. Security:
Password Hashing:
Use a hashing algorithm to store passwords in the database securely (I have used the bcrypt package).

Input Validation:
Validate user input on the server side to prevent common security vulnerabilities (I have used the Joi package).

4. Authorization:
Role-based Access Control (RBAC):
Implement roles (e.g., user, admin) with different access levels.

5. Testing:
Unit and Integration Testing:
Write unit tests for critical components such as authentication and blog post creation.

6. Database:
 Use a database service (MongoDB) for data storage.
